I am a level 10 C++ software developer and blog about software development and other techy stuff. Usage of C++ and Rust,
scripting done in Python or straight shell scripts. Interest in software architecture, networking and recently OS
development (uff). I try out new stuff and like creating things by combining existing technolgy.
