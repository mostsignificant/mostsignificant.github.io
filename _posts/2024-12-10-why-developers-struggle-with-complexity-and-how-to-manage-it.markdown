Complexity is part of the software engineering job. 

But too much complexity can become overwhelming. Too many tools, processes, domain-specific knowledge, company-specific practices, business-related peculiarities will hinder productivity and flexibility.

This article will introduce the developer's cognitive load model. This model explains the connections of the complexity between software engineering, domain and business. 

Understanding and managing this complexity can lead to more efficient, focused and productive work. And in the end it will make the software engineering life much more pleasant.



## Why Complexity is a Challenge for Developers

Too many variables: Discuss how balancing tools, domain knowledge, and company knowledge creates mental overload.
Cognitive load: Introduce the concept of cognitive load and how it impacts decision-making, focus, and overall productivity.
The mental model of a developer: Explain the three key areas of complexity (Tools, Domain, Company Knowledge) and why each requires a different set of focus and understanding.

### Tech

### Domain

### Business

## How Complexity Affects Productivity

Why is this complexity a problem?

- Reduced decision-making speed:

- Increased likelihood of burnout:

- Less focus time:

Reduced decision-making speed: When there’s too much complexity in any area, developers struggle to make decisions and problem-solve quickly.
Increased likelihood of burnout: The higher the cognitive load, the more likely it is that developers will experience burnout or fatigue.
Lower focus time: Cognitive overload causes distractions and reduces a developer’s ability to enter deep work or flow states.

## Balancing Complexity: The Developer’s Cognitive Load Model

Tools Knowledge: Acknowledge that developers must be proficient in the programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools they use. However, too much variety or complexity can overload the brain.
Domain Knowledge: Show how understanding the industry-specific intricacies (finance, healthcare, etc.) is essential but can also add significant mental strain.
Company-Specific Knowledge: Discuss the importance of understanding the codebase, internal processes, and workflows within the organization.

## Practical Strategies for Managing Complexity

Prioritize and streamline: Simplify tools and frameworks when possible. If the domain is complex, look for ways to reduce the complexity of your tech stack.
Focus on one area at a time: Be mindful of overloading on domain knowledge or company-specific complexities if you already have a challenging tech stack.
Regularly reassess your environment: Encourage developers to periodically evaluate how their tools, domain knowledge, and company knowledge are impacting their cognitive load.

## How Companies Can Help

Clear onboarding processes: Provide a structured onboarding plan to reduce the complexity of understanding the company’s systems and practices.
Training and upskilling: Offer training sessions or workshops to build domain knowledge and technical skills, helping to lighten the load.
Code and system simplification: Advocate for keeping the codebase and system architecture as simple as possible while still meeting business goals.
Business simplification

## Conclusion

Summarize the key ideas: managing complexity across tools, domain, and company knowledge is crucial to maintaining productivity and focus.
Call to action: Encourage readers to reflect on their current projects and identify which area (tools, domain, company) is adding unnecessary complexity and how they can reduce it for improved productivity.
