We take a different approach to using ChatGPT as an assistant in software development. 99% of tutorials show how to use AI for generating source code. But in reality, writing new source code makes just 20% of a software developer's daily workload. There are a lot of other tasks that can be improved and simplified with ChatGPT. This article shows seven areas where this can be applied:

- Review
- Testing
- Documentation
- Debugging
- Architecture
- Refactoring
- Automation

We will sketch out the general concept for applying ChatGPT in these areas and give some concrete examples including practical prompts for further inspiration to get started. Let's get started.

## 1. Automated Code Review

You can use ChatGPT to review code changes. Identify inefficient code, find code smells and potential bugs in new source code from the latest pull request.

How does this look like in practice?

> Please review the following JavaScript code for any potential errors or warnings. Classify the issues found into 'Errors' (critical problems) and 'Warnings' (suggestions or improvements). Provide explanations and suggestions for fixes where applicable.

```js
function fetchData(url) {
  let data = null;

  // Simulate fetching data from an API
  fetch(url)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((json) => {
      data = json;
      console.log(data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    });

  return data; // Issue: Returning data before the fetch is completed
}

fetchData("https://api.example.com/data");
```

## 2. Test Code Generation

## 3. Documentation Creation

## 4. Debugging Assistance

## 5. Architectural Planning

Introduction
Briefly introduce ChatGPT and its widespread reputation for code generation.
State your intention: to explore underutilized areas in software development where ChatGPT can be a powerful ally.
Mention the breadth of examples youâ€™ll cover, emphasizing practical, actionable insights.
Section 1: Automated Code Review
What It Is: Use ChatGPT to identify inefficiencies, code smells, and potential bugs in existing code.
Applications:
For C++: Finding memory mismanagement or improving STL usage.
For Rust: Spotting borrowing issues or enhancing idiomatic code.
Preview Spin-off: Link to deeper dives for language-specific examples.
Section 2: Test Code Generation
What It Is: Generating unit tests, integration tests, or property-based tests tailored to your code.
Applications:
For C++: Create Google Test cases for algorithms or classes.
For Rust: Generate comprehensive quickcheck property tests.
Preview Spin-off: Examples of automating repetitive testing tasks.
Section 3: Documentation Creation
What It Is: Helping developers generate detailed and reader-friendly API docs or project overviews.
Applications:
For C++: Draft API documentation for template-heavy libraries.
For Rust: Use idiomatic comments to generate cargo doc-friendly output.
Preview Spin-off: Show concrete examples of polished documentation in action.
Section 4: Debugging Assistance
What It Is: Explaining complex compiler errors, runtime exceptions, or performance bottlenecks.
Applications:
For C++: Analyze segmentation faults or linker errors.
For Rust: Decode borrow-checker complaints or async task issues.
Preview Spin-off: Share how ChatGPT can untangle cryptic error messages efficiently.
Section 5: Architectural Planning
What It Is: Leveraging ChatGPT to design software architecture, from high-level diagrams to module breakdowns.
Applications:
For C++: Structuring a real-time system with concurrency.
For Rust: Designing a microservice architecture with async support.
Preview Spin-off: Explore concrete examples for real-world projects.
Section 6: Refactoring and Code Modernization
What It Is: Using ChatGPT to upgrade legacy code to modern practices or simplify complex logic.
Applications:
For C++: Modernizing C++98 to C++20 features.
For Rust: Refactoring to more idiomatic patterns like iterators and combinators.
Preview Spin-off: Show before-and-after transformations guided by ChatGPT.
Section 7: Workflow Automation
What It Is: Generating boilerplate code, scripts, or automating repetitive tasks in development workflows.
Applications:
For C++: Automating header generation or build script updates.
For Rust: Creating macros or scaffolding new crates.
Preview Spin-off: Dive into automation examples for each language.
