  Everybody needs a blog and what better time to start it than now. I am planning to write on different topics from 
  programming, libraries, frameworks, to software development best and worst practices. Sprinkle in some of my hobbies
  for a potpourri of tech-related articles.

This is indeed my first post in this blog. It is just a description of what you can expect from this sort of blog. I
like to spend some of my free time toying around with different programming languages, frameworks or libraries. So
instead of having 100s of unfinished projects on my hard drive dying the legacy-death, I decided to finish some of them
to a MVP\* and write about it.

\*MVP = Minimum Viable Prototype in this case

Every developer has this one `/projects` folder containing these dormant code-piles waiting to be never completed. Even
if you are not planning to do so, it is worth writing about it. Maybe someone else finds it interesting. Maybe someone
else learns something. Maybe a laugh at a silly idea puts a smile on someone's face.

Even if writing might not be my top skill: I try to use this as a chance to improve. A little bit quantity-driven,
because the more you write, the better you will get (eventually hopefully). I hope you will enjoy these endevours with
me and leave me some feedback if you like it or if you find something to improve. Thank you! Keep on coding and keep on
creating!
