  As a software engineer you have to hold yourself to your own set of standards. But how do you get started with a good set of practices in a world full of programming advice? How does this fit to your own set of problems and to your own personality? I will show you the steps to develop your very own adaptable framework of principles that will help you through every-day software developer life and grow in the process.

I need your advice for a (tech) blog post. I want to write about as a software engineer you have to build your own set of principles and guidelines when developing from other sets of principles like clean code, design patterns, coding guidelines, code complete etc. instead of blindly adapting one code set you have to constantly improve on your own set of principles, learn, adapt, repeat. please suggest some articles, make a short structure (how to get started with principles, how to add new ones, how to remove unfitting one, how to adapt your principles to existing work environments, growing your principles with the team and challenges, and how to communicate your principles to others)

- Do not follow blindly a pre-made set of principles.
- Always question your own principles.
  - Do they still apply within my context? Jobs change, programming languages and frameworks change, the code base changes, as do your principles have to change.
- Apply, learn, adapt, repeat. It is like the cornerstone of the original Agile Manifesto–just applied to your set principles.
- Review regularly.
- Apply your principles in the following ways:
  - When writing code. When writing tests. When writing requirements, specifications. When drawing architecture diagrams.
  - Review: Create a set of checkpoints to go through every time you review your work. Should you review your own work? You absolutely should. Before commit and push: review your code. Before sending that specification: review your work.

## Why Bother

The question is: why bother?

You get paid to write code. Writing bad code does not have direct consequences. Writing really bad code might get you fired. But you the next coding gig is right around the next corner.

Your job fills a third of your day. Five days a week. Two days to regenerate. Five days again. Coding and everything around it takes a substantial amount of your time.

If you are happy with just code do not bother reading on. You are good to go.

There already is a plethora of guidelines and principles and best practices. Why bother creating your own set? Clean Code, SOLID, etc. should be more than enough? Don't follow any guidelines blindly.

Personal growth is a life-long journey. You have to grow in your relationships. As a spouse, partner, friend. You have to grow in your profession. As a colleague, team member, employee or employer. And especially as an expert in your field.

> Learn, adapt, repeat.

## Stealing Like An Artist (Or Engineer)

Getting Started with Your Principles
Identify foundational sources (e.g., Clean Code, Design Patterns, Agile Manifesto).
Reflect on your own experiences: successes, failures, and frustrations.
Write down your initial principles as a starting point (keep it simple).

## Improving And Growing And Improving

Stay curious: read books, follow blogs, and engage in discussions.
Evaluate new ideas critically: does it solve a problem you've faced?
Incorporate new practices gradually and test their impact.

The last principle of the original Agile Manifesto goes like this:

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Apply the same principle to your own set of principles. But how do you apply this?

Set up regular reminders to review your set of principles. For the beginning, a monthly review should be enough. Afterwards you can increase these intervals, but I would aim for a semi-annual review.

What should a review include?

1. Find obsolete principles.

Conduct a retrospective: which principles are not working? Acknowledge when a principle is outdated or irrelevant to your work and working environment.

Removing stuff is not admitting you were wrong, but growing.

2. Add new principles.

3. Review existing principles.

## Adapting To The Environment

Adapting Principles to Work Environments

Align personal principles with team/company standards where possible.
Understand organizational constraints (e.g., legacy systems, timelines).
Balance pragmatism and idealism in applying your principles.

## Getting Others On Board

Growing Principles with Your Team

Share your principles as ideas, not mandates, with your team.
Encourage collaborative discussions to align and evolve together.
Be open to learning from teammates and integrating their insights.

Communicating Your Principles Effectively

Use clear, simple language to explain your principles.
Demonstrate value with examples: “Here’s why this worked for me.”
Stay open to feedback: communication is a two-way street.

## Overcoming Challenges

Balancing personal ideals with real-world constraints.
Dealing with criticism or skepticism.
Staying consistent while remaining open to change. 9. Conclusion: The Journey of Constant Improvement

## Further Reading

Reiterate the importance of growth: learn, adapt, repeat.
Encourage readers to take the first step and stay flexible.
Leave with an inspirational message: principles aren’t static—they’re tools for your growth as an engineer.
